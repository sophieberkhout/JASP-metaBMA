### Bayesian Meta-Analysis Models

| Fixed-effects H<sub>0</sub> | Fixed-effects H<sub>a</sub>|
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|There is one true effect size that is equal to zero, and any observed differences in effect size per study are due to sampling error.| There is one true effect, and all studies share that exact same effect size.|

|Random-effects H<sub>0</sub> | Random-effects H<sub>a</sub> |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| On average there is no effect. but effect sizes of individual studies van vary. H | On average there is an effect, and the observed effect sizes vary across studies. |

##### Bayesian Model Averaging
When you are not interested in distinguishing between the fixed-effects and the random-effects model, you can do a Bayesian model averaged meta-analysis (which is used in the example). This analysis calculates average estimates between the two models.

##### Constrained Random (Ordered) Effects
Sometimes you are completely certain that an effect must be positive or must be negative. If that is the case, you can do a constrained random effects analysis. Here, you restrict the effect sizes to show one direction only.
